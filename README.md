# Linear-Block-Code
## Aim:
To test how well linear block codes (like Hamming codes) detect and correct errors in noisy communication channels.

## Tools Required:

  * Colab (for executing Python code)
  * Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib
    
## Program:
~~~
~~~
## Output:

## Results:

  * The codes could detect multiple errors and correct single errors.
  * They reduced transmission errors significantly compared to uncoded data.
  * Encoding/decoding remained fast and practical for real-world use.

The experiment showed linear block codes improve data reliability without complex computations.
